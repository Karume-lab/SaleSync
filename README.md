This repository includes the implementation of various features for the sales management system. The following features have been successfully implemented:

### Product Catalogue
Users can create and manage a comprehensive list of products, including details such as name, description, price, and quantity in stock. This feature enables easy organization and tracking of available products.

### Admin and Teller Accounts
Administrators have full control over the system and can create teller accounts for sales representatives with limited access. This feature ensures secure user management and different levels of system access.

### Sales Processing
Users can create and manage sales transactions, select products from the catalogue, input quantities, and generate sales invoices. This feature streamlines the sales process and provides a centralized interface for managing sales transactions.

### User Authentication
Secure access control ensures that only authorized individuals with valid credentials can log in to the system. This feature protects sensitive data and ensures secure access to the sales management system.

### Sales Reports Generation
Users can generate reports based on sales data, including revenue, best-selling products, and customer trends. This feature provides valuable insights into sales performance and facilitates data-driven decision-making.

### Discount Application on Sales
Automatic discount application to sales transactions that exceed a predefined threshold, encouraging higher-value purchases.

### Automatic Calculation of Tax
The system automatically calculates the tax amount based on the price of items, eliminating manual calculations and ensuring accuracy.

### Offline Mode
The system can be used without internet access, allowing sales transactions to be processed and stored locally. Once the internet connection is restored, the system synchronizes offline data with the server.
